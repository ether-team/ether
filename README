This project is an implementation of commit / post-recieve hooks for various
VCS systems, that send a notification to an AMQP server containing payload
that follows the github payload spec :

https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/docs/github_payload

Unit test cases

1. Check that when a commit is done a new payload is sent both by SVN and GIT
   hooks
    - mimic commit retrievial
    - mimic payload sending (implement TestSender fake class)
    - make sure that JSON data follows the specs from the URL above

2. Check senders
    - mimic pika with Mox
    - make sure that the whole code is covered with tests

3. Check base listener
    - mimic pika with Mox
    - make sure that the whole code is covered with tests
