POST-COMMIT HOOK

 The post-commit hook is invoked after a commit.  Subversion runs
 this hook with the following ordered arguments:

   [1] REPOS-PATH   (the path to this repository)
   [2] REV          (the number of the revision just committed)
 Because the commit has already completed and cannot be undone,
 the exit code of the hook program is ignored.
